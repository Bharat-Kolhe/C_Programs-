1. A positive integer is entered through the keyboard; write a program to obtain the prime factors of the number. Modify the function suitably to obtain the prime factors recursively

2. Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of two successive terms gives the third term. Following are the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89...

3. A positive integer is entered through the keyboard; write a function to find the binary equivalent of this number using recursion.

4. Write a C function to evaluate the series sin(x) = x − (x 3 / 3!) + (x 5 / 5!) − (x 7 / 7!) +……… to five significant digits.

5. If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are denoted by a, b, and c, then area of triangle is given by Area = √𝑆(𝑆 − 𝑎)(𝑆 − 𝑏)(𝑆 − 𝑐) Where, S = ( a + b + c ) / 2
